A  simple note taking application with a little touch of hash-tags.

I have written this as a learning opportunity for me to use Django user authentication(not fully) and to get more 
used to end-to-end development. So far, the app doesn't do much but I am still working on it. I am pushing most of
the code to Bitbucket and pushing here from time to time. 

Implemented features: 
* Django Login and Registration(will go back to it for refinement)
* Add Note with Hash tags
* Filter by hash tag
* Delete Note

Features road map:
* Suggest hash tags from previous ones while entering a new note
* Add Due date for entered note
* Add Colors to notes based on due date
* mor tp come...
